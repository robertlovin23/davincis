                    <li class = "left-align"><h5 >Kyle A. -</h5> <p>Bread is great!  Meal came with 3 small rolls and butter. Salad with house Italian dressing that was very sweet.
                        hicken Parmesan was great!  It was topped with chunky marinara sauce and mozzarella
                        and a side of spaghetti with same chunky style marinara sauce. Lots of garlic in salad dressing and red sauce. Fast and high quality service at lunch. Highly recommend!</p></li>

                           <p>The service was quick and our waiter was polite. My pasta sampler was literally the best pasta I've ever eaten. The texture with the ricotta cheese was mouthwatering.
                             The portion was completely adequate (for less than $9!). The tomato sauce went great with the dish. The cheese baked on top of the dish was slightly crunchy and I wanted more of it. Also, they bring out bread
                              at the beginning of the meal and it was so soft and yummy! I definitely recommend this place!</p></li>
